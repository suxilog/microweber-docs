### Installation via Command Line

If you haveven't downloaded the zip file get it from here [https://microweber.com/download.php](https://microweber.com/download.php "") 

You can also download Microweber via Composer

You can install Microweber directly from the command line interface. This may be useful in shell scripts that automate the site creation process. 


Here's an example of what the command looks like:

```bash
php artisan microweber:install admin@site.com admin pass 127.0.0.1 site_db root secret -p site_
```



This would initialize the Microweber database on localhost in database "site_db" using user "root" with password "secret" for the connections. In case the database user doesn't have a password you can skip setting that argument (and also be ashamed of your attitude to security). All tables will be prefixed by "site_". After the schema initialization an admin user will be created with credentials "admin"/"pass" and email "admin@site.com".
All arguments until the database password are required and need to be present in that exact order.
